## Description
  
Avoid using the NOT IN predicate in a WHERE clause. (Sargable)
  
## Summary
  
Avoid using NOT IN predicate in the WHERE clause.
  
### Remarks
  
Using NOT IN predicate in the WHERE clause generally performs badly, because the SQL Server
optimizer has to use a TABLE SCAN instead of an INDEX SEEK even the filtering columns are
covered by index.
