## Description
  
Local cursor not closed.
  
## Summary
  
Local cursor not closed
  
### Remarks
  
The rule checks if any local cursor is closed until the end of the batch. Because when open,
the cursor still holds locks on referred-to-tables or views, you should explicitly close it
as soon as it is no longer needed.
