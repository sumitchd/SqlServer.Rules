## Description
  
SET NOCOUNT ON is recommended to be enabled in stored procedures and triggers.
  
## Summary
  
SET NOCOUNT ON is recommended to be enabled in stored procedures and triggers
  
### Remarks
  
This rule scans triggers and stored procedures to ensure they SET NOCOUNT to ON at the
 beginning. Use SET NOCOUNT ON at the beginning of your SQL batches, stored procedures and
 triggers in production environments, as this prevents the sending of DONE_IN_PROC messages
 and suppresses messages like '(1 row(s) affected)' to the client for each statement in a
 stored procedure. For stored procedures that contain several statements that do not return
 much actual data, setting SET NOCOUNT to ON can provide a significant performance boost,
 because network traffic is greatly reduced.
